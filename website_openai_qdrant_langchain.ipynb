It contains a minimal payload that includes enough data needed to display information on a page about the user who is signed in for presentation purposes (e.g name, email, image).You can use the session callback to customize the session object returned to the client if you need to return additional data in the session object.useSession()\\u200bClient Side: YesServer Side: NoThe useSession() React Hook in the NextAuth.js client is the easiest way to check if someone is signed in.It works best when the <Provider> is added to pages/_app.js.Example\\u200bimport { useSession } from \"next-auth/client\"export default function Component() {  const [session, loading] = useSession()  if (session) {    return <p>Signed in as {session.user.email}</p>  }  return <a href=\"/api/auth/signin\">Sign in</a>}getSession()\\u200bClient Side: YesServer Side: YesNextAuth.js provides a getSession() method which can be called client or server side to return a session.It calls /api/auth/session and returns a promise with a session object, or null if no session exists.Client Side Example\\u200basync function myFunction() {  const session = await getSession()  /* ... */}Server Side Example\\u200bimport { getSession } from \"next-auth/client\"export default async (req, res) => {  const session = await getSession({ req })  /* ... */  res.end()}noteWhen calling getSession() server side, you need to pass {req} or context object.The tutorial securing pages and API routes shows how to use getSession() in server side calls.getCsrfToken()\\u200bClient Side: YesServer Side: YesThe getCsrfToken() method returns the current Cross Site Request Forgery Token (CSRF Token) required to make POST requests (e.g. for signing in and signing out).You likely only need to use this if you are not using the built-in signIn() and signOut() methods.Client Side Example\\u200basync function myFunction() {  const csrfToken = await getCsrfToken()  /* ... */}Server Side Example\\u200bimport { getCsrfToken } from \"next-auth/client\"export default async (req, res) => {  const csrfToken = await getCsrfToken({ req })  /* ... */  res.end()}getProviders()\\u200bClient Side: YesServer Side: YesThe getProviders() method returns the list of providers currently configured for sign in.It calls /api/auth/providers and returns a list of the currently configured authentication providers.It can be useful if you are creating a dynamic custom sign in page.API Route\\u200bpages/api/example.jsimport { getProviders } from \"next-auth/client\"export default async (req, res) => {  const providers = await getProviders()  console.log(\"Providers\", providers)  res.end()}noteUnlike getSession() and getCsrfToken(), when calling getProviders() server side, you don\\'t need to pass anything, just as calling it client side.signIn()\\u200bClient Side: YesServer Side: NoUsing the signIn() method ensures the user ends back on the page they started on after completing a sign in flow. It will also handle CSRF Tokens for you automatically when signing in with email.The signIn() method can be called from the client in different ways, as shown below.Redirects to sign in page when clicked\\u200bimport { signIn } from \"next-auth/client\"export default () => <button onClick={() => signIn()}>Sign in</button>Starts Google OAuth sign-in flow when clicked\\u200bimport { signIn } from \"next-auth/client\"export default () => (  <button onClick={() => signIn(\"google\")}>Sign in with Google</button>)Starts Email sign-in flow when clicked\\u200bWhen using it with the email flow, pass the target email as an option.import { signIn } from \"next-auth/client\"export default ({ email }) => (  <button onClick={() => signIn(\"email\", { email })}>Sign in with Email</button>)Specifying a callbackUrl\\u200bThe callbackUrl specifies to which URL the user will be redirected after signing in. It defaults to the current URL of a user.You can specify a different callbackUrl by specifying it as the second argument of signIn(). This works for all providers.e.g.signIn(null, { callbackUrl: \\'http://localhost:3000/foo\\' })signIn(\\'google\\', { callbackUrl: \\'http://localhost:3000/foo\\' })signIn(\\'email\\', { email, callbackUrl: \\'http://localhost:3000/foo\\' })The URL must be considered valid by the redirect callback handler. By default it requires the URL to be an absolute URL at the same hostname, or else it will redirect to the homepage. You can define your own redirect callback to allow other URLs, including supporting relative URLs.Using the redirect: false option\\u200bnoteThe redirect option is only available for credentials and email providers.In some cases, you might want to deal with the sign in response on the same page and disable the default redirection. For example, if an error occurs (like wrong credentials given by the user), you might want to handle the error on the same page. For that, you can pass redirect: false in the second parameter object.e.g.signIn(\\'credentials\\', { redirect: false, password: \\'password\\' })signIn(\\'email\\', { redirect: false, email: \\'bill@fillmurray.com\\' })signIn will then return a Promise, that resolves to the following:{  /**   * Will be different error codes,   * depending on the type of error.   */  error: string | undefined  /**   * HTTP status code,   * hints the kind of error that happened.   */  status: number  /**   * `true` if the signin was successful   */  ok: boolean  /**   * `null` if there was an error,   * otherwise the url the user   * should have been redirected to.   */  url: string | null}Additional params\\u200bIt is also possible to pass additional parameters to the /authorize endpoint through the third argument of signIn().See the Authorization Request OIDC spec for some ideas. (These are not the only possible ones, all parameters will be forwarded)e.g.signIn(\"identity-server4\", null, { prompt: \"login\" }) always ask the user to reauthenticatesignIn(\"auth0\", null, { login_hint: \"info@example.com\" }) hints the e-mail address to the providernoteYou can also set these parameters through provider.authorizationParams.noteThe following parameters are always overridden server-side: redirect_uri, statesignOut()\\u200bClient Side: YesServer Side: NoUsing the signOut() method ensures the user ends back on the page they started on after completing the sign out flow. It also handles CSRF tokens for you automatically.It reloads the page in the browser when complete.import { signOut } from \"next-auth/client\"export default () => <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign out</button>Specifying a callbackUrl\\u200bAs with the signIn() function, you can specify a callbackUrl parameter by passing it as an option.e.g. signOut({ callbackUrl: \\'http://localhost:3000/foo\\' })The URL must be considered valid by the redirect callback handler. By default this means it must be an absolute URL at the same hostname (or else it will default to the homepage); you can define your own custom redirect callback to allow other URLs, including supporting relative URLs.Using the redirect: false option\\u200bIf you pass redirect: false to signOut, the page will not reload. The session will be deleted, and the useSession hook is notified, so any indication about the user will be shown as logged out automatically. It can give a very nice experience for the user.tipIf you need to redirect to another page but you want to avoid a page reload, you can try:\\nconst data = await signOut({redirect: false, callbackUrl: \"/foo\"})\\nwhere data.url is the validated url you can redirect the user to without any flicker by using Next.js\\'s useRouter().push(data.url)Provider\\u200bUsing the supplied React <Provider> allows instances of useSession() to share the session object across components, by using React Context under the hood.This improves performance, reduces network calls and avoids page flicker when rendering. It is highly recommended and can be easily added to all pages in Next.js apps by using pages/_app.js.pages/_app.jsimport { Provider } from \"next-auth/client\"export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {  return (    <Provider session={pageProps.session}>      <Component {...pageProps} />    </Provider>  )}If you pass the session page prop to the <Provider> – as in the example above – you can avoid checking the session twice on pages that support both server and client side rendering.This only works on pages where you provide the correct pageProps, however. This is normally done in getInitialProps or getServerSideProps like so:pages/index.jsimport { getSession } from \"next-auth/client\"...export async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {  return {    props: {      session: await getSession(ctx)    }  }}If every one of your pages needs to be protected, you can do this in _app, otherwise you can do it on a page-by-page basis. Alternatively, you can do per page authentication checks client side, instead of having each auth check be blocking (SSR) by using the method described below in alternative client session handling.Options\\u200bThe session state is automatically synchronized across all open tabs/windows and they are all updated whenever they gain or lose focus or the state changes in any of them (e.g. a user signs in or out).If you have session expiry times of 30 days (the default) or more then you probably don\\'t need to change any of the default options in the Provider. If you need to, you can can trigger an update of the session object across all tabs/windows by calling getSession() from a client side function.However, if you need to customise the session behaviour and/or are using short session expiry times, you can pass options to the provider to customise the behaviour of the useSession() hook.pages/_app.jsimport { Provider } from \\'next-auth/client\\'export default function App ({ Component, pageProps }) {  return (    <Provider session={pageProps.session}      options={{        clientMaxAge: 60     // Re-fetch session if cache is older than 60 seconds        keepAlive:    5 * 60 // Send keepAlive message every 5 minutes      }}      >      <Component {...pageProps} />    </Provider>  )}noteThese options have no effect on clients that are not signed in.Every tab/window maintains its own copy of the local session state; the session is not stored in shared storage like localStorage or sessionStorage. Any update in one tab/window triggers a message to other tabs/windows to update their own session state.Using low values for clientMaxAge or keepAlive will increase network traffic and load on authenticated clients and may impact hosting costs and performance.Client Max Age\\u200bThe clientMaxAge option is the maximum age a session data can be on the client before it is considered stale.When clientMaxAge is set to 0 (the default) the cache will always be used when useSession is called and only explicit calls made to get the session status (i.e. getSession()) or event triggers, such as signing in or out in another tab/window, or a tab/window gaining or losing focus, will trigger an update of the session state.If set to any value other than zero, it specifies in seconds the maximum age of session data on the client before the useSession() hook will call the server again to sync the session state.Unless you have a short session expiry time (e.g. < 24 hours) you probably don\\'t need to change this option. Setting this option to too short a value will increase load (and potentially hosting costs).The value for clientMaxAge should always be lower than the value of the session maxAge option.Keep Alive\\u200bThe keepAlive option is how often the client should contact the server to avoid a session expiring.When keepAlive is set to 0 (the default) it will not send a keep alive message.If set to any value other than zero, it specifies in seconds how often the client should contact the server to update the session state. If the session state has expired when it is triggered, all open tabs/windows will be updated to reflect this.The value for keepAlive should always be lower than the value of the session maxAge option.noteSee the Next.js documentation for more information on _app.js in Next.js applications.Alternatives\\u200bCustom Client Session Handling\\u200bDue to the way Next.js handles getServerSideProps / getInitialProps, every protected page load has to make a server-side query to check if the session is valid and then generate the requested page. This alternative solution allows for showing a loading state on the initial check and every page transition afterward will be client-side, without having to check with the server and regenerate pages.pages/admin.jsxexport default function AdminDashboard() {  const [session] = useSession()  // session is always non-null inside this page, all the way down the React tree.  return \"Some super secret dashboard\"}AdminDashboard.auth = truepages/_app.jsxexport default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {  return (    <Provider session={pageProps.session}>      {Component.auth ? (        <Auth>          <Component {...pageProps} />        </Auth>      ) : (        <Component {...pageProps} />      )}    </Provider>  )}function Auth({ children }) {  const [session, loading] = useSession()  const isUser = !!session?.user  React.useEffect(() => {    if (loading) return // Do nothing while loading    if (!isUser) signIn() // If not authenticated, force log in  }, [isUser, loading])  if (isUser) {    return children  }  // Session is being fetched, or no user.  // If no user, useEffect() will redirect.  return <div>Loading...</div>}It can be easily be extended/modified to support something like an options object for role based authentication on pages. An example:pages/admin.jsxAdminDashboard.auth = {  role: \"admin\",  loading: <AdminLoadingSkeleton />,  unauthorized: \"/login-with-different-user\", // redirect to this url}Because of how _app is done, it won\\'t unnecessarily contact the /api/auth/session endpoint for pages that do not require auth.More information can be found in the following Github Issue.NextAuth.js + React-Query\\u200bThere is also an alternative client-side API library based upon react-query available under nextauthjs/react-query.If you use react-query in your project already, you can leverage it with NextAuth.js to handle the client-side session management for you as well. This replaces NextAuth.js\\'s native useSession and Provider from next-auth/client.See repository README for more details.Edit this pageLast updated on Apr 17, 2023 by Balázs OrbánPreviousExample CodeNextREST APIuseSession()getSession()getCsrfToken()getProviders()signIn()signOut()ProviderOptionsAlternativesCustom Client Session HandlingNextAuth.js + React-QueryAbout NextAuth.jsIntroduction\\n\\n\\nDownloadGitHubNPMAcknowledgementsContributorsSponsorsImages by unDrawNextAuth.js © Iain Collins 2023\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://next-auth.js.org/v3/getting-started/client', 'title': 'Client API | NextAuth.js', 'description': 'The NextAuth.js client library makes it easy to interact with sessions from React applications.', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

These can be defined in cypress.json under the key env as well, however since we\\'re storing username / passwords in here we should keep those in a separate file and only commit cypress.json to version control, not cypress.env.json.cypress.env.json{  \"GOOGLE_USER\": \"username@company.com\",  \"GOOGLE_PW\": \"password\",  \"COOKIE_NAME\": \"next-auth.session-token\",  \"SITE_NAME\": \"http://localhost:3000\"}You must change the login credentials you want to use, but you can also redefine the name of the GOOGLE_* variables if you\\'re using a different provider. COOKIE_NAME, however, must be set to that value for NextAuth.js.Third, if you\\'re using the cypress-social-login plugin, you must add this to your /cypress/plugins/index.js file like so:cypress/plugins/index.jsconst { GoogleSocialLogin } = require(\"cypress-social-logins\").pluginsmodule.exports = (on, config) => {  on(\"task\", {    GoogleSocialLogin: GoogleSocialLogin,  })}Finally, you can also add the following npm scripts to your package.json:\"test:e2e:open\": \"cypress open\",\"test:e2e:run\": \"cypress run\"Writing a test\\u200bOnce we\\'ve got all that configuration out of the way, we can begin writing tests to login using NextAuth.js.The basic login test looks like this:cypress/integration/login.jsdescribe(\"Login page\", () => {  before(() => {    cy.log(`Visiting https://company.tld`)    cy.visit(\"/\")  })  it(\"Login with Google\", () => {    const username = Cypress.env(\"GOOGLE_USER\")    const password = Cypress.env(\"GOOGLE_PW\")    const loginUrl = Cypress.env(\"SITE_NAME\")    const cookieName = Cypress.env(\"COOKIE_NAME\")    const socialLoginOptions = {      username,      password,      loginUrl,      headless: true,      logs: false,      isPopup: true,      loginSelector: `a[href=\"${Cypress.env(        \"SITE_NAME\"      )}/api/auth/signin/google\"]`,      postLoginSelector: \".unread-count\",    }    return cy      .task(\"GoogleSocialLogin\", socialLoginOptions)      .then(({ cookies }) => {        cy.clearCookies()        const cookie = cookies          .filter((cookie) => cookie.name === cookieName)          .pop()        if (cookie) {          cy.setCookie(cookie.name, cookie.value, {            domain: cookie.domain,            expiry: cookie.expires,            httpOnly: cookie.httpOnly,            path: cookie.path,            secure: cookie.secure,          })          Cypress.Cookies.defaults({            preserve: cookieName,          })          // remove the two lines below if you need to stay logged in          // for your remaining tests          cy.visit(\"/api/auth/signout\")          cy.get(\"form\").submit()        }      })  })})Things to note here include, that you must adjust the CSS selector defined under postLoginSelector to match a selector found on your page after the user is logged in. This is how Cypress knows whether it succeeded or not. Also, if you\\'re using another provider, you will have to adjust the loginSelector URL.Edit this pageLast updated on Apr 17, 2023 by Balázs OrbánSetting up CypressWriting a testAbout NextAuth.jsIntroduction\\n\\n\\nDownloadGitHubNPMAcknowledgementsContributorsSponsorsImages by unDrawNextAuth.js © Iain Collins 2023\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://next-auth.js.org/v3/tutorials/testing-with-cypress', 'title': 'Testing with Cypress | NextAuth.js', 'description': 'To test an implementation of NextAuth.js, we encourage you to use Cypress.', 'language': 'en'})]\n"
